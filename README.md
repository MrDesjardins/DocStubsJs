# DocStubsJs
An extension for Visual Studio 2013+ to auto generate documentation comment placeholder for TypeScript in [JsDoc Format](http://usejsdoc.org/)


## Contributing

In order to run Visual Studio's plugin development environment for this extension, you will need Visual Studio 2013 Professional (Ultimate or Premium work, too) and its [SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30668) installed.

### How it works

Type /** at the top of a typescript method or class and this one will generate the comment placeholder.
